# AltSight

sudo apt-get install espeak python-espeak

## Inspiration ✨
From the perspective of someone who is visually impaired, the world seems to be a bit different but with the power of technology, we can change that. Using state-of-the-art (Google cloud vision in this case) object detection algorithms, their worldview can be improvised.
## What it does? 👨‍🚀
It is a custom, and portable object recognition device that can be worn as a cap, and can be connected to most audio devices. This wearable will play out the names of objects that are encountered by the user, who is supposedly visually impaired in this case.
## How I built it? 🏗
This setup is equipped with a raspberry pi, camera, and a power source which is a USB adapter as of now, but can be replaced with a 18650 lithium ion battery. With the help of Google's Cloud Vision API, I got most probable name of the object in front of the camera and used espeak on it, which is an open-source text-to-speech library in python.
## Challenges I ran into 😨
I'm traveling most of the time this weekend, and had less than 18 hours to build it, so I built a quick project.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of 🚀
I'm proud of myself for finishing up the whole project in a short span of time.
## What I learned? 🏫
It is calm and cozy to write up devpost submissions in a train.
## What's next for AltSight? 🥠🔮
I'll make it fully portable once I have an Li-Ion battery and its adapter.
